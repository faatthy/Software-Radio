## Introduction 
Software-defined radio (SDR) revolutionizes the way radio systems are conceptualized and 
implemented. By bringing the processing tasks closer to the antenna, SDR converts traditional 
hardware problems into software challenges. The core principle of SDR lies in its ability to 
define transmitted waveforms and demodulate received signals entirely through software, a 
stark departure from conventional radios reliant on analog circuitry or hybrid digital-analog 
systems. 
In the realm of SDR, the transmitter's code defines modulation techniques, coding schemes, 
and other crucial parameters. Beyond its traditional application in wireless communication, SDR 
extends its utility to wired data transmission, replacing antennas with cable connections and 
employing various line codes. These codes facilitate framing, coding, and line modulation, 
enabling seamless data transmission through wired channels.
